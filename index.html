                <p> A cliche, standard, and generic shoujo. However, it is done good so far. I tend to cringe and the stereotypical shoujo moments, but it kept me intrigued and wanting more. I guess I'll start trying to take pointers from these guys because these girls eat them up haha. It's always funny to me when popular characters have a fan-club in the school. Anyway, it decent time, worth a watch if you need a little romance anime in your life.</p>

                <h1>Hitori Bocchi</h1>
                <h2>April 5, 2019</h2>

                <p> As someone who has suffered from extreme social anxiety, it's always nice to see you're not the only one with mind-boggling self conciousness. Bocchi is an adorable air-head and we must protecc. Shows like this might be a little cringe, but they are loveable, and that's all I need. It encourages me to try to make new friends.</p>
